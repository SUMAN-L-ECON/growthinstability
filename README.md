CAGR and Instability Analysis (CDVI)
1. Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)
CAGR measures the mean annual growth rate of an investment, value, or metric over a specified period, assuming the value compounds annually at a constant rate.
		CAGR = (Ending Value / Beginning Value)(1/n) – 1
•	Ending Value: Value at the end of the period
•	Beginning Value: Value at the start of the period
•	n: Number of years (or periods)
Step-by-Step Procedure
1.	Identify Values:
Note the beginning value and ending value of the metric (e.g., sales, investment, production).
2.	Determine Number of Periods:
Calculate the number of years (or periods) between the two values.
3.	Apply Formula:
•	Divide the ending value by the beginning value.
•	Raise the result to the power of 1/n.
•	Subtract 1 to obtain the CAGR as a decimal. Multiply by 100 to express as a percentage.
4.	Interpretation:
The result represents the average annual growth rate over the period, smoothing out year-to-year fluctuations.
Example Calculation:
 Suppose an investment grows from ₹100,000 to ₹155,000 over 11 years:
CAGR = (155,000 / 100,000)^(1/11) – 1 = 0.0448 or 4.48%
This means the investment grew at an average rate of 4.48% per year over 11 years.

Using regression method?
1. Transform Your Data
•	Let Yt be the value of your variable (e.g., sales, production) at time t.
•	Take the natural logarithm of each value: lnYt.
2. Set Up the Regression Equation
•	Use the log-linear model:
ln(Yt)=a+bt+ut
Where:
•	a: Intercept
•	b: Slope (represents the average annual growth rate in log terms)
•	ut: Error term
3. Run the Regression
•	Regress ln(Yt) on t (the time period) to obtain the estimated slope coefficient (b).
4. Interpret the Slope
•	The estimated b gives the average annual growth rate in log terms.
•	To convert b to the CAGR percentage:
CAGR (%)=(eb−1)×100
Where e is the base of the natural logarithm.
Interpretation:
The series grew at an average compound rate of 4.6% per year over the period.

2. Instability Analysis (Cuddy-Della Valle Index, CDVI)
CDVI is used to measure instability or volatility in time series data, especially when the data shows a trend. It corrects the coefficient of variation (CV) for the presence of a trend, providing a more accurate measure of instability.
Formulas
a. Coefficient of Variation (CV):
CV (%) = (σ / μ) × 100
•	σ: Standard deviation of the series
•	μ: Mean of the series
b. Cuddy-Della Valle Index (CDVI):
CDVI = CV × √(1 – adj.R²)
•	CV: Coefficient of Variation (as a percentage)
•	R²: Coefficient of determination from the trend regression (usually linear)
Step-by-Step Methodological Procedure
1.	Collect Time Series Data:
Obtain the data series (e.g., annual production, export values) for the period under study.
2.	Fit a Trend Line:
Perform a regression analysis (often linear) to fit a trend to the data:
Yt = a + bt + ut
Or, in log-linear form:
log Yt = log a + t log b + log ut
3.	Calculate the coefficient of determination (R²) from this regression.
4.	Calculate the Coefficient of Variation (CV):
Compute the mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) of the original series.
Apply the CV formula.
5.	Compute CDVI:
Substitute CV and R² into the CDVI formula.
This adjusts the CV for the presence of a trend, providing a more accurate measure of instability.
6.	Interpretation:
CDVI Ranges:
0–15: Low instability
15–30: Medium instability
30: High instability
A higher CDVI indicates greater instability in the data series.
Example Calculation:
Suppose for a time series:
•	CV = 20%
•	Adj.R² = 0.64
CDVI = 20 × √(1 – 0.64) = 20 × √0.36 = 20 × 0.6 = 12%
Interpretation: With a CDVI of 12%, the series exhibits low instability.
Summary Table: CAGR vs. CDVI
Aspect	CAGR	CDVI (Instability Index)
Purpose	Measures average annual growth rate	Measures volatility/instability in series
Formula	(End/Begin)(1/n) – 1	CV × √(1 – adj.R²)
Input Needed	Begin & End value, number of periods	Data series, trend regression (R²), CV
Interpretation	Higher = faster, steadier growth	Higher = more instability
